Fall 2016 Schedule
=============================

The fall schedule is consolidated from a Locus report in a different order than we have been showing courses for previous semesters. Note that there are separate sections starting on new pages for each "campus", semester schedule, and course prefix, where online is considered a campus, as well as Watertower, Lakeshore, and the new Cuneo mansion campus. For example that means the Watertower Comp 348 and online Comp 348 appear on completely different pages. Eight week sessions are also separated. Note that some of the 8-week courses that are automatically generated by Locus are only for School of Continuing and Professional Studies students.

The schedule is always subject to change. We try to display the latest version. The current enrollments may well have changed since the last report. Be sure to check Locus for courses that are open.
