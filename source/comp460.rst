:doc:`comp363`


Description
----------------------------

The design and analysis of algorithms is central to computer science. This
course will focus both on presenting general techniques for designing correct
and efficient algorithms, as well as on formal methods for proving the
correctness and analyzing the complexity of such algorithms. Also included
will be an introduction to the theory of NP-completeness, whereby certain
computation problems can be classified as being difficult in a formal sense.
