Description
--------------------

This course will cover techniques for detecting the unusual usage
patterns that typically signal a break-in.  The course will also
consider differences in detection of local intruders versus intrusion
over networks.  Finally  issues in the prosecution of those breaking in
to computers, particularly evidentiary issues are explored. 

Outcome
