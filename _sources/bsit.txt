Students gain the talents and skills to be successful in todayâ€™s organizations following current industry practices: planning, designing, implementing and administering data information and knowledge bases that can be effectively mined; assessing the information and data requirements of an organization and implementing these requirements as an information system; and functioning as an effective member of an information services division in an organization.
