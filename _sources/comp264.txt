:doc:`comp163` or |math201| (corequisite or prerequisite) or declared Computer Science, Computer Crime & Forensics or Information Technology Minor

Description
--------------------

This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the
hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern
computer system. The course is particularly geared towards topics of
interest to a programmer, i.e., topics that affect the performance,
correctness, or utility of user-level programs. Since this investigation
is best carried out using the C programming language, the course will
include some instruction in C for programming familiar with Java.

Outcome
----------------------

Understanding of system issues that affect the performance, correctness, or utility of user-level programs.
