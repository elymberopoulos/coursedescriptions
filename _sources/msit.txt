==============================

Overview
--------

future effects of the convergence of the telecommunications, media, 
and information technology sectors.  

Courses may be taken in Chicago, online or at our *new* :ref:`vernon-hills` campus. 

Entirely Online Option
-----------------------

*The program can now be completed entirely online* 
with some  decrease in available electives.    
Networking and security tracks may be completed online and full-time.
The management tracks can be completed online at least part-time over two years. 
Students taking mostly regular face-to-face courses are also welcomed into 
online courses when they find that convenient, but students signed up explicitly
