COMP 413: Intermediate Object-Oriented Development
=======================================================

Credit Hours
-----------------------------------

3

Prerequisites
----------------------------

:doc:`comp271` (strictly enforced)

Description
----------------------------

Object-orientation continues to be a dominant approach to software development. This intermediate programming-intensive course studies the use of classes and objects with an emphasis on collaboration among objects.

**Overall Series of Object-Oriented Courses**
  
- :doc:`comp170` (CS1) - simple objects representing scalars
- :doc:`comp271` (CS2) - collections of simple objects
- :doc:`comp313` / :doc:`comp413` - complex, interacting objects; basic design patterns
- :doc:`comp373` / :doc:`comp473` - advanced design patterns and topics such as AOP(Aspect-Oriented programming)

:doc:`comp313` / :doc:`comp413` is also a prerequisite for other advanced software courses. Students interested in advanced software courses are encouraged to take :doc:`comp313` / :doc:`comp413` as soon as they have completed :doc:`comp271` so as to be eligible for these further courses.

**Course Topics**

-  Data Structures of various types – linear vs. nonlinear, indexing vs.
   non-indexing, position vs. value-oriented
-  Advanced Java, e.g. interfaces, annotations, exceptions, generics,
   collections, boxing/unboxing, array objects
-  Object Modeling – UML, use cases and activity diagrams, class
   diagrams, archetypes, interaction diagrams
-  Design by contract, interfaces, refactoring & generalization, design
   patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Composite, Strategy, Iterator, Abstract
   Factory, Visitor, …)
-  Agile Development Process – evolutionary design, test-driven
   development, refactoring, …
-  Tools – Eclipse, Subversion, JUnit, JMock, Ant, …
-  Techniques – object pooling, garbage collection, performance
   profiling (NetBeans)

Outcome
---------

A thorough understanding of the principles of object-orientation: abstraction, delegation, inheritance, and polymorphism; exposure to basic design patterns; programming experience in mainstream object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java.

You will take your software development abilities to the next level by building on your knowledge of data structures.

You will learn to design and implement more complex programs using good software engineering practices, including:

-  Designing with interfaces and composition
-  Design patterns
-  Refactoring
-  Test-driven development (TDD)
